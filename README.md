# TodoTree

A protoytype for an Android to do list inspired by [Simply Do](https://code.google.com/p/simply-do/). The idea is that every item in every list can itself be a list. This allows you to break tasks down into ever smaller tasks.

## Get Started

The project should import into Android Studio and build without issue.
